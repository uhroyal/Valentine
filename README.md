## DirtyWrld Valentine's Day Website 💌

// This site is mostly used for asking your loved one to be your valentine. 
// Open source so you can edit it and change it however you'd want! - My website with the valentine github on it: https://dirtywrld.cc/valentine

This is a super simple, kinda cheeky little Valentine's Day page I threw together.
**"Will you be my Valentine?"**

Two buttons to pick from:

- **Yes ofc** - Redirects you to index2.html and gives you a prompt   
- **No lol** - You enter full screen as soon as you click no and the button runs away from you.
